# Vehicle Recognition
Vehicle type recognition using convolutional neural network

The project is about vehicles type recognition using Neural Network (Deep Learning) with Keras and Tensorflow.

The model using transfer learning from TF-HUB (https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_140_224/feature_vector/4)
